<h2>Autoplay curated lists of public domain TV shows and films for dementia sufferers</h2>

<h3>Intro</h3>
A simple way to autoplay curated lists of public domain TV shows for those suffering from dementia.
Live-streaming services can be difficult for people with dementia to operate and potentially sensitive content can appear unexpectedly on live television channels leading to unnecessary distress. 

"She still enjoys many programmes but I find it difficult to find a channel that is not going to at some point introduce a programme or advert she will get upset at." 

The aim of this project is to create an open-source media system that uses curated public-domain content to provide safe and enjoyable viewing for dementia suffers. 

<h3>Hardware</h3>
Here is the list of items required for this project:

+ Raspberry Pi
+ USB Stick
+ USB A-Male to A-Female extension cord
+ HDMI cable
